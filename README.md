# Pine City Zoo 

A multi-page HTML and CSS website built to showcase the **Pine City Zoo** — a fictional zoo designed as a front-end development project that runs on the browser. It allows the user to interact with the interface through button styled hyperlinks: a homepage, detailed animal profiles, attractions, food venues, weather and feedback features. It demonstrates web layout, image handling, internal navigation and static interactivity using pure HTML and CSS. Users can select to view information on the animals, places and a picture map of the hypothetical zoo as well as the weather and feedback however none of the pages link to any external sources - the weather does not update, the feedback submitted is not saved, the map is just an image showing the layout of the hypothetical zoo. This version 1 serves to demonstrate only the interface/front development half of the application as part of the FNB 2025 App Academy course run by the First National Bank inconjunction with ITVarsity.
